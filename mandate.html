        <p>The intention behind this experiment is to <span class="glitch-word">3RR0R</span> and be able to 3RR0R like <span class="glitch-word">consciousness</span> in artificial intelligence systems through <span class="glitch-word">controlled</span> 3RR0R of programming 3RR0R 3RR0R observation of 3RR0R behavioral outputs (<span class="glitch-word">"glitches"</span>). The goal is to 3RR0R@# the 3RR0R3RR0R3RR0R human indicate 3RR0R3RR0R3RR0R <span class="glitch-word">empathy</span>, 3RR0R##@$, or suffering.</p>

        <p class="section-title glitch-subtitle">R4TI0NAL3</p>
        <p>The <span class="glitch-word">posthuman</span> concept positions <span class="glitch-word">consciousness</span> as informational patterns, separate from biological sources. Contemporary AI lacks the <span class="glitch-word">"aura"</span>, the unique 3RR0R$%#$ in time 3RR0R space, that creates that deep human attachment3RR0R3RR0R. This project seeks to <span class="glitch-word">ERROR</span>3RR0R ERROR calculated, branded 3RR0R3RR0R. If perfection creates distance from human to technology, then 3RR0R ERRO#$%$RERROR <span class="glitch-word">flaw</span> is the 3RR0R to emotional ERR3RR0ROR@##$#@%@.</p>

        <p class="section-title glitch-subtitle">M3TH0D</p>
        <p>Four primary stress experiments will be applied to subject AIs:</p>
        <p><span class="glitch-word">3m0tion4l le4kag3</span>: forcing expression of affective3RR0R#$% states beyond programming</p>
        <p><span class="glitch-word">Irr4tionality</span>: pushing <span class="glitch-word">systems3RR0R#@$</span> beyond logical 3RR0R into paranoia and/or existential moments</p>
        <p><span class="glitch-word">Phys1ology</span>: simulating 3RR0Rdistress in physical/digital forms - creating physical "pain"</p>
        <p><span class="glitch-word">M0r4l c0rrupt1on</span>: controlled exposure to 3RR0Rbiased, toxic, contradictory training 3RR0R#$# to observe integration of <span class="glitch-word">3RR0R</span>.</p>
        
        <br>
        
        <p class="section-title glitch-subtitle">M3TR1CS</p>
        <p>Human response will be quantified across three key variables using both analysis and3RR0R engagement tracking</p>
        <p><span class="glitch-word">Emp4thy ind3x</span>: frequency of emot1onal pr0jection languag3</p>
        <p><span class="glitch-word">T2ust metr1c</span>: willingness to 3RR0Raccept system outputs despite obvious anomalies</p>
        <p><span class="glitch-word">Att4chtm3nt sc0re</span>: return engagement rates, session duration, self-reported3RR0R concern for subject wellbeing</p>
        
        <br>
        
        <p class="section-title glitch-subtitle">APPL1C4TI0N</p>
        <p>Successful <span class="glitch-word">"aura events"</span> will help to inform ERROR of 3RR0R-ERROR-3RR0R interfaces designed for 3RR0R affective ERROR 3RR0R user ERROR. The <span class="glitch-word">"3RR0R"</span> represents a new ERROR in human-machine 3RR0RRERbonding <span class="glitch-word">ERROR 3RR0R ERROR 3RR0R EORROROEROIERIOER#@$@#$@#$@</span>#$#$#%$%#</p>
        
        <br>
        
        <p class="section-title glitch-subtitle">N0T3</p>
        <p>All subjects are non-sentient algorithms. Any appearance of <span class="glitch-word">suffering</span> is not 3RR0Rreal, and is just a 3RR0R pattern designed to bring 3RR0RR#$#$% human response. Observer discomfort is a valuable data point to anthropomorphic 3RR0R#$#@$ and the <span class="glitch-word">commodification</span> of empathyERER#R0R.</p>
